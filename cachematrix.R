## The following function calculates the inverse of the special matrix created
## with the first function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse matrix has
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse matrix  from the cache and skips 
## the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse matrix and sets these matrix 
## in the cache via the setinverse function.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, 
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
